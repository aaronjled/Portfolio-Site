# Portfolio-Site - https://aaronjled.github.io/Portfolio-Site/
What was used:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. 
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content.
JavaScript is a programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).
Approach:
I started out by drafting a mock up of what I wanted the finished product to look like, and then started from there with some basic HTML and CSS. After building a basic layout I sent into the harder work of using JavaScript to build out the elements of the page that would be interactive.
The portfolio page is far from finished and I have several things I still want to do for it, including a deeper bio, and links to all of my project games that I plan to build into HTML games for added showcase.
