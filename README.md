# Portfolio-Site
Portfolio Site
Have the following pages:
home (greeting page)
bio (your background)
resume (past work experience)
projects (a place to hold interesting projects that you build)
links (links to your github, linkedin, and other sites you find interesting)
optionally, instead of making this a separate page, you can make these links appear as part of a navigation section that appears on all pages
Use JS/JQuery to create at least three points of interaction for the user (e.g. the user clicks on something and something happens). Write these from scratch. Use of 3rd party frameworks/libraries like jQuery UI, bootstrap, etc will not be allowed for this requirement!
Implement responsive design (i.e. it should be fully functional on desktop, tablet, mobile, etc.).
